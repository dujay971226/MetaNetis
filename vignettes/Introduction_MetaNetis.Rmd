## Introduction

MetaNetis is an $\text{R}$ package designed to bridge the gap between raw 
metabolomics data and deep biological interpretation. It provides a novel
framework for benchmarking user-supplied metabolite concentrations against a 
robust, healthy human reference population derived from resources like the Human
Metabolome Database ($\text{HMDB}$).

The package's core value lies in its ability to generate high-confidence 
classifications and translate those classifications into functional insights 
about metabolic pathway activity.

Critically, MetaNetis offers robust functionality to evaluate quantitative, 
clinical sampled data such as blood and urine. This capability is a key 
differentiator from existing tools; for instance, popular platforms like 
MetaboAnalyst are often restricted to qualitative analysis, relying solely on 
pathway enrichment. MetaNetis moves beyond simple enrichment to provide a direct,
directional assessment of metabolic activity (e.g., hyper- or hypo-regulation), 
making it a powerful tool for metabolomic and clinical research.

This document gives a tour of MetaNetis (version 0.1.0). It was written in R 
Markdown, using the knitr package for production. See help(package = "MetaNetis")
for further details.

## Limitations of the $\text{MetaNetis}$ Package

The $\text{MetaNetis}$ package is strictly based on data from the Human 
etabolome Database ($\text{HMDB}$). Users should be aware of the following 
limitations:  

1. Nomenclature Dependency (HMDB Only): The package is designed exclusively 
around $\text{HMDB}$ identifiers and nomenclature. It is not natively compatible
with data using other coding systems, such as $\text{KEGG}$ (Kyoto Encyclopedia 
of Genes and Genomes). External conversion is required for non-$\text{HMDB}$ 
inputs.  

2. Reference Range Coverage: All standard reference ranges for concentration 
status determination ('High,' 'Low') are sourced from $\text{HMDB}$ via 
GetRefRanges. Consequently, reference ranges may be missing for some metabolites
in the database. You could work around it by using the SetAltBaseline function 
to define custom 'Normal' ranges based on internal control samples, ensuring 
comprehensive scoring.  


<br>

To download **MetaNetis**, follow the following commands:

```{r}
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dujay971226/MetaNetis", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("MetaNetis")
```

To list all sample functions available in the package:

``` {r}
ls("package:MetaNetis")
```

To list all sample datasets available in the package:

```{r}
data(package = "MetaNetis")
```

<br>

## Applications

Let's started with viewing reference metabolite range:

```{r}
ref_df <- MetaNetis::GetRefRanges()
head(ref_df)
```

<br>

This reference data was generated by aggregating metabolite range from healthy 
human samples.  
If you wish to use another reference range, feel free to use 
SetAltBaseline(your_data)  
your_data can be either a csv path or a data frame.  

Next, we will mock a metabolite sample dataset:

```{r}
# Make a mock reference data
mock_reference_data <- data.frame(
 'HMDB_ID' = c("HMDB0000001", "HMDB0000001", "HMDB0000002", "HMDB0000003", "HMDB0000005"),
 'Metabolite_Name' = c("Alanine", "Alanine", "Glucose", "Creatinine", "Missing_Metab"),
 'Sample_Type' = c("Urine", "Plasma", "Plasma", "Urine", "Plasma"),
 'Min_Age(year)' = c(0, 11, 0, 0, 0),
 'Max_Age(year)' = c(99, 99, 99, 99, 99),
 'Min_Concentration(Healthy)' = c(500, 150, 4.0, 50, 200),
 'Max_Concentration(Healthy)' = c(1000, 300, 7.0, 100, 400),
 check.names = FALSE
)

# User's Input
user_data <- data.frame(
 Sample_A = c(250, 6.0, 120, 50),
 Sample_B = c(160, 12.0, 60, 50),
 row.names = c("HMDB0000001", "HMDB0000002", "HMDB0000003", "HMDB0000004")
)

# Age and Sample Type
age_vector <- c(5, 20)
sample_type_vector <- c("Urine", "Plasma") # Sample A is Urine, Sample B is Plasma

```

The Reference Dataframe must contain all specified columns shown above for the 
calculation.  
User data must be structured as a matrix where rows are identified by HMDB_ID 
and columns by sample names.  
Metadata fields like age and sample type can be provided either as a single 
value or as a vector whose length exactly matches the number of samples.

<br>

Then, we will run that through MetabAnalysis, which classifies metabolite level
as "High", "Normal", "Low" based on the reference HMDB range. If the coresponding
reference range was not found, it will be classified as "Missing":

```{r}
# Test Case: Matching by HMDB_ID
results_id <- MetaNetis::MetabAnalysis(
 data_input = user_data,
 age = age_vector,
 sample_type = sample_type_vector,
 match_by = "HMDB_ID",
 ref_data_override = mock_reference_data
)

print(results_id)
```
For Sample A, as the age range is 11+, 5 year old a can't match a range for 
0000002 as for 0000004, it wasn't in the mock reference data frame at all. 
Hence, [Low, Missing, High, Missing].

<br>

As this dataset size is too small to show a network, I will be creating another 
set of mock data:

```{r}
# Mock reference data and samples
metab_to_pwys <- data.frame(
  Metabolite_Name = c("Glucose", "Fructose", "Lactate", "Pyruvate",
                      "Cholesterol", "Leucine", "Valine", "Isoleucine",
                      "Tryptophan", "Serotonin"),
  HMDB_ID = c("HMDB00001", "HMDB00002", "HMDB00003", "HMDB00004",
              "HMDB00005", "HMDB00006", "HMDB00007", "HMDB00008",
              "HMDB00009", "HMDB00010"),
  Pathway_Name = c("Glycolysis", "Glycolysis", "Energy Metabolism",
                   "Energy Metabolism", "Lipid Metabolism", "BCAA Metabolism",
                   "BCAA Metabolism", "BCAA Metabolism", "Serotonin Synthesis",
                   "Serotonin Synthesis"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Create input data where metabolite names are in the row names, simulating
# the typical output from metab_results.
metabolites <- c("Glucose", "Fructose", "Lactate", "Pyruvate",
                 "Cholesterol", "Leucine", "Valine", "Isoleucine",
                 "Tryptophan", "Serotonin", "Unmapped Metabolite")

# Sample analysis result generated by MetabAnalysis
metab_results <- data.frame(
  Sample1 = c("Low", "Low", "High", "High", "Normal", "High", "Normal", 
              "High", "Low", "Normal", "High"),
  Sample2 = c("High", "Low", "Normal", "High", "Low", "Normal", "High", 
              "High", "Normal", "Low", "Low"),
  Sample3 = c("Normal", "Low", "High", "Normal", "Low", "Normal", "Normal",
              "High", "High", "High", "Normal"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Assign metabolite names as row names directly, as required by the function
rownames(metab_results) <- metabolites
```

Then we can run our mapping:

``` {r}
result <- MapToPathway(metab_results = metab_results,
                       match_by = "Metabolite_Name",
                       alt_pwy_map = metab_to_pwys)
result
```

The Net Score system measures the overall status of a metabolic pathway based on
the concentrations of its individual metabolites (molecules). Each metabolite 
receives a score by comparing its current concentration to a normal, reference 
range (like those found in HMDB). If the concentration of a metabolite is higher
than the normal range, it is scored as +1, indicating accumulation. Conversely, 
if the concentration is lower than the normal range, it is scored as -1, 
indicating depletion. A metabolite that falls within the normal reference range 
receives a score of 0. The final Net Score for the entire pathway is then 
calculated by simply adding up all the individual metabolite scores.

<br>

This final summed Net Score is used to classify the entire pathway's activity. 
If the Net Score is greater than +1 (such as +2 or +3), the pathway is classified
as "Hyperactive", suggesting strong overall accumulation. If the score is less 
than -1 (such as -2 or -3), it is classified as "Hypoactive", indicating strong 
overall depletion. If the score is exactly +1, the pathway is described as having
"Mild Activation", and if it is exactly -1, it is considered to have 
"Mild Inhibition". Finally, if the Net Score is exactly 0, the pathway is 
categorized as having "Normal Activity".

<br>

Lastly, Let's try plotting the Network with a new mock dataset:

```{r}
# Define 12 pathways
pathways <- c(
  "Glycolysis", "Energy Metabolism", "Lipid Metabolism",
  "BCAA Metabolism", "Serotonin Synthesis", "Histidine Metabolism",
  "TCA Cycle", "Purine Metabolism", "Pyrimidine Metabolism",
  "Fatty Acid Oxidation", "Amino Acid Metabolism", "Urea Cycle"
)

# Create 50 metabolites
metabolites <- paste0("Metab", 1:50)
hmdb_ids <- paste0("HMDB", sprintf("%05d", 1:50))

# Each metabolite participates in 2-4 random pathways to create dense connections
metab_to_pwys <- tibble::tibble()
for (i in 1:50) {
  n_paths <- sample(2:4, 1)
  temp <- tibble::tibble(
    Metabolite_Name = rep(metabolites[i], n_paths),
    HMDB_ID = rep(hmdb_ids[i], n_paths),
    Pathway_Name = sample(pathways, n_paths)
  )
  metab_to_pwys <- dplyr::bind_rows(metab_to_pwys, temp)
}

# Mock pathway results per sample
  result <- expand.grid(
    Sample_ID = c("Sample1", "Sample2"),
    Pathway_Name = pathways
  ) %>%
    tibble::as_tibble() %>%
    dplyr::mutate(
      Net_Score = sample(-3:3, n(), replace = TRUE),
      Metabolites_Affected = sample(1:10, n(), replace = TRUE),
      Activity_Status = sample(c(
        "Hyperactive", "Normal Activity", "Hypoactive", "Mild Inhibition"
      ), n(), replace = TRUE)
    )
```

Now Plot!

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=8, out.width='600px'}
PlotNetwork(result, "Sample1")
```

each node is a pathway, and an edge connects two pathways if they share at least
one metabolite. Node color is determined by pathway Net_Score: 
(red = hyperactive, blue = hypoactive).
