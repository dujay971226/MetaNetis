# MetaNetis

## Description

$\text{MetaNetis}$ is an \R package purpose-built a novel tool for 
metabolomics studies by classifying metabolite samples against a robust, 
internally-curated baseline derived from the $\text{Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)}$. 
The core biological data being analyzed are metabolite concentration values 
(e.g., 12 umol/L of glucose in blood sample) and their functional associations with 
metabolic pathways. MetaNetis significantly improves the current workflow 
in computational biology by providing 
$\text{novel, quantitative functional interpretation}$. 
Unlike tools such as MetaboAnalyst, which typically rely on pathway 
enrichment statistics, MetaNetis compares results against 
$\text{real-world, sample-matched metabolite reference data}$ 
and directly links individual concentration deviations to pathway activity 
(Hypoactive/Hyperactive). This unique approach eliminates the interpretation 
bias inherent in generic comparisons and allows for the precise, quantitative 
assessment of functional metabolic changes. Development for $\text{MetaNetis}$
was conducted on R version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13 ucrt) using 
Windows 10 x64 (build 19045).

## Installation

You can install the development version of MetaNetis from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/dujay971226/MetaNetis) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dujay971226/MetaNetis", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("MetaNetis")
```
To run the Shiny app:
``` r
runMetaNetis()
``` 

## 🎯 Overview
MetaNetis is an $\text{R}$ package designed to bridge the gap between raw 
metabolomics data and deep biological interpretation. It provides a novel
framework for benchmarking user-supplied metabolite concentrations against a 
robust, healthy human reference population derived from resources like the 
Human Metabolome Database ($\text{HMDB}$).

The package's core value lies in its ability to generate high-confidence 
classifications and translate those classifications into functional insights 
about metabolic pathway activity.

Critically, MetaNetis offers robust functionality to evaluate quantitative, 
clinical sampled data such as blood and urine. This capability is a key 
differentiator from existing tools; for instance, popular platforms like 
MetaboAnalyst are often restricted to qualitative analysis, relying solely 
on pathway enrichment. MetaNetis moves beyond enrichment to provide 
a direct, directional assessment of metabolic activity 
(e.g., hyper- or hypo-regulation), making it a powerful tool for metabolomic 
and clinical research.

### ✨ Features

\itemize{
  \item $\text{Standardized Concentration Analysis (\code{MetabAnalysis}):}$
    \itemize{
      \item $\text{Benchmarking:}$ Compares input concentrations to a cleaned, aggregated HMDB baseline.
      \item $\text{High-Precision Filtering:}$ Applies **sample-specific filters** for both \code{age} (in years) and
        **biospecimen type** (e.g., \code{Urine}, \code{Plasma}, \code{CSF}).
      \item $\text{Classification:}$ Classifies each metabolite concentration as \code{"Low"}, \code{"Normal"}, or 
        \code{"High"}.
    }
  
  \item $\text{Functional Pathway Mapping (\code{MapToPathway}):}$
    \itemize{
      \item $\text{Dependency:}$ Used an external pathway map from HMDB for linking metabolites to 
        pathways.
      \item $\text{Scoring:}$ Calculates a **Net Score** for each pathway based on the sum of activated (+1) and 
        inhibited (-1) metabolites.
      \item $\text{Activity Level:}$ Determines the overall pathway activity as \code{"Hypoactive"}, \code{"Normal 
        Activity"}, or \code{"Hyperactive"}.
    }

  \item $\text{Flexible Data Management:}$
    \itemize{
      \item Uses a default, curated HMDB reference baseline via \code{GetRefRanges()}.
      \item Allows researchers to easily override the default data with custom reference ranges using 
        \code{SetAltBaseline()}.
    }
}

``` r
ls("package:MetaNetis")
data(package = "MetaNetis") 
browseVignettes("MetaNetis")
```

`MetaNetis` contains 7 functions.

1.  ***GetRefRanges*** for retrieving the established reference concentration 
ranges sourced from HMDB (Human Metabolome Database), used to classify metabolite values.

2.  ***SetAltBaseline*** for setting an alternative comparison baseline 
(instead of the standard reference) for subsequent metabolite analysis.

3.  ***MetabAnalysis*** for comparing raw metabolite concentration values 
in samples against reference ranges or baselines to determine if each metabolite is 'High,' 'Low,' or 'Normal.'

4.  ***GetPathwayMap*** for loading the internal data frame that links 
individual metabolite identifiers to their respective metabolic pathways sourced from HMDB.

5.  ***MapToPathway*** for aggregating the metabolite concentration status scores
for a given sample into a single Net Score for each pathway, indicating pathway activity status.

6.  ***PlotNetwork*** for generating a visual network graph that displays 
pathways as nodes, colored by their Net Score, and links them based on the number of shared metabolites.

7.  ***runMetaNetis*** for executing the shiny interface, including loading 
sample data, scoring, mapping, and network visualization.


## Contribution

Author and Core Package ContributionsThe package MetaNetis was conceived and 
primarily developed by $\text{Jay Du}$. Jay's core contributions include 
designing the novel quantitative scoring framework that moves beyond traditional
enrichment analysis, developing the robust data processing pipeline for 
standardizing the Human Metabolome Database ($\text{HMDB}$) reference ranges, 
and implementing the functional pathway scoring logic (MapToPathway and 
MetabAnalysis). Significant effort was dedicated to creating a modular and 
testable package structure, ensuring that core data retrieval functions 
(GetPathwayMap, GetRefRanges) and visualization tools (PlotNetwork) are 
seamlessly integrated.

\itemize {
  \item GetPathwayMap: Relies on $\text{HMDB}$ data for metabolite-to-pathway 
  associations.
  \item GetRefRanges: Built upon extensively processed $\text{HMDB}$ Reference 
  Data XML content.
  \item MapToPathway: Uses dplyr for filtering, grouping, and summing scores to 
  calculate the Net_Score, tibble::rownames_to_column to prepare input data, 
  and tidyr to pivot the data from wide to long format for efficient processing.
  \item MetabAnalysis: Uses dplyr::case_when for conditional logic to categorize
  raw concentrations ('High', 'Low', 'Normal') against the $\text{HMDB}$ baseline,
  relying on stringr if complex pattern matching is needed during data preparation.
  \item PlotNetwork: Uses igraph to construct the network structure (graph object)
  and ggraph (which extends ggplot2) to render the high-quality spatial layout 
  (e.g., layout_with_kk) and color-coded visualization based on pathway scores
  \item SetAltBaseline: Primarily uses dplyr to manage and update the internal 
  data frame structures for alternative baselines.
  \item runMetaNetis: $\text{DT}$ (DataTables) provides the interactive, sortable,
  and searchable data tables, while shiny, shinyjs, and shinyWidgets handle the 
  core application structure, client-side effects, and enhanced UI controls.

Generative AI Tool ContributionsThe generative AI tool, Gemini, served as a key 
collaborative partner throughout the development of MetaNetis. Its assistance 
was instrumental in ensuring code stability and clarity across the package. 
Specifically, Gemini was utilized to generate clear, comprehensive commenting 
and documentation for all core functions within the package. Furthermore, 
the AI tool provided essential debugging support for both the \code{MapToPathway}
and \code{MetabAnalysis} functions, helping to resolve complex issues related to
quantitative score aggregation and data matching across disparate input 
structures, ensuring the reliability of the core analytical pipeline.
