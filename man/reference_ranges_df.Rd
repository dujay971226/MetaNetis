\title{Standardized Human Metabolite Reference Ranges (MetaNetis Baseline)}
\format{
A data frame with rows representing unique metabolite, biofluid, and age group combinations, and 10 columns:
\describe{
 \item{HMDB_ID}{Unique identifier of the metabolite.}
 \item{Metabolite_Name}{Common name of the metabolite.}
 \item{Sample_Type}{Standardized biological fluid type (e.g., Blood/Serum/Plasma, CSF, Urine).}
 \item{Subject_Age_Description}{The original age group description from the HMDB dataset.}
 \item{Min_Age(year)}{Minimum age (in years) for the applicable age group.}
 \item{Max_Age(year)}{Maximum age (in years) for the applicable age group (\code{Inf} for general adult groups).}
 \item{Min_Concentration(Healthy)}{Minimum concentration observed in healthy individuals within the age group.}
 \item{Mean_Concentration(Healthy)}{Aggregated average concentration in healthy individuals within the age group.}
 \item{Max_Concentration(Healthy)}{Maximum concentration observed in healthy individuals within the age group.}
 \item{Unit}{The unit of measurement for concentration (e.g., uM, umol/mmol creatinine).}

\description{
A pre-processed and aggregated dataset containing healthy human reference
ranges for metabolites derived from the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB).
This table forms the standardized baseline for comparison within the \code{MetaNetis} package.
}
\details{
The original HMDB data was extensively cleaned to produce a robust dataset
suitable for comparing user metabolomic profiles against healthy controls.
The key cleaning and standardization steps performed include:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Filtering:} Removed all non-specific entries such as "Unknown,"
        "Not Specified," and ranges containing only one reference (e.g., mean only).
  \item \strong{Merging & Ranging:} Metabolite entries were grouped by Name,
        Biofluid, and Subject Age Description. The final \code{Min_Concentration}
        and \code{Max_Concentration} ranges were determined by taking the
        minimum of all minimums and the maximum of all maximums for the
        metabolite group with same Sample_Type and Subject_Age_Description.
  \item \strong{Age Standardization:} Age ranges were parsed from free-text
        descriptions and converted into standardized \code{Min_Age(year)} and
        \code{Max_Age(year)} columns, handling units (days, months, years)
        and symbols (>, <, single values).
