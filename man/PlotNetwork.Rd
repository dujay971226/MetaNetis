\usage{
PlotNetwork(pathway_status_df, sample_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathway_map_df}{A data frame (the result of MapToPathway) that must
contain at least two columns: \code{Metabolite} (character/factor) and
\code{Pathway} (character/factor). This map defines which metabolites belong
to which pathways.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{ggplot} object (via \code{ggraph}).
}
\description{
Creates a static, high-quality network visualization of biochemical pathways
using the \code{ggraph} package, based on a pre-filtered metabolite-to-pathway map.

The network highlights connections between pathways that share common metabolites.
This function takes the direct output of a mapping process (e.g., MapToPathway),
constructs a unipartite graph (pathways as nodes), and uses \code{ggraph}
for layout and plotting.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Assuming MapToPathway returns a data frame like this:
  mock_pathway_map <- data.frame(
    Metabolite = c("Glucose", "Fructose", "ATP", "ADP", "Citrate", "Isocitrate"),
    Pathway = c("Glycolysis", "Glycolysis", "Glycolysis", "TCA cycle", "TCA cycle", "TCA cycle")
  )

  network_plot <- PlotNetwork(mock_pathway_map)
  print(network_plot)
}
