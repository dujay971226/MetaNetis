\title{Retrieve Standardized Human Metabolite Reference Ranges}
\usage{
GetRefRanges()
}
\value{
Returns an the 'reference_range_df' data frame to the user. Includes the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{HMDB_ID}: Unique identifier of the metabolite.
  \item \code{Metabolite_Name}: Common name of the metabolite.
  \item \code{Sample_Type}: Standardized biological fluid type (e.g., Blood/Serum/Plasma, CSF, Urine).
  \item \code{Subject_Age_Description}: The original age group description from the HMDB dataset.
  \item \code{Min_Age(year)}: Minimum age (in years) for the applicable age group.
  \item \code{Max_Age(year)}: Maximum age (in years) for the applicable age group (\code{Inf} for general adult groups).
  \item \code{Min_Concentration(Healthy)}: Minimum concentration observed in healthy individuals within the age group.
  \item \code{Mean_Concentration(Healthy)}: Aggregated average concentration in healthy individuals within the age group.
  \item \code{Max_Concentration(Healthy)}: Maximum concentration observed in healthy individuals within the age group.
  \item \code{Unit}: The unit of measurement for concentration (e.g., uM, umol/mmol creatinine).
}
}
\description{
Loads the final, cleaned, and aggregated human reference range data frame
(`reference_ranges_df`) used in this package, which was generated by processing
the Human Metabolome Database Metabolite(HMBD) Reference Data XML dataset
from \url{https://hmdb.ca/downloads}.

The original HMDB data was extensively cleaned to produce a robust dataset
suitable for comparing user metabolomic profiles against healthy controls.
The key cleaning and standardization steps performed include:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Filtering:} Removed all non-specific entries such as "Unknown,"
        "Not Specified," and ranges containing only one reference (e.g., mean only).
  \item \strong{Merging & Ranging:} Metabolite entries were grouped by Name,
        Biofluid, and Subject Age Description. The final \code{Min_Concentration}
        and \code{Max_Concentration} ranges were determined by taking the
        minimum of all minimums and the maximum of all maximums for the
        metabolite group with same Sample_Type and Subject_Age_Description.
  \item \strong{Age Standardization:} Age ranges were parsed from free-text
        descriptions and converted into standardized \code{Min_Age(year)} and
        \code{Max_Age(year)} columns, handling units (days, months, years)
        and symbols (>, <, single values).
}

This function first checks for the existence of the object in the global environment
and loads it from the package data if missing.
